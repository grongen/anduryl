    Calculate decision maker (DM).

    This function can be applied with and without optimisation, and for different weight types.

    Pseudo code
    -----------
    Calculate calibration and information score for each expert
    Get answers of all experts, and scale to log when it is a log-scale question
    Get weights for all experts, given the chosen weight type.
    Get lower and upper bound for each item
    Get the CDF for all experts and items, as well as the unique answers.
    for each item:
        Multiply the CDF per expert with the weight of the expert, and sum for all experts (dot product)
        for each significance level (only one if no optimistion):
            Interpolate the percentiles within the weighted answers
            Convert the log-scale questions back to a linear scale
    if optimisation:
        Create an expert (DM) for each significance level, and pick the one with the highest weight.
